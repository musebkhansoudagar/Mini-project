# Reverse Engineering of Kick Cycle

A mini project focused on the systematic reverse engineering, CAD reconstruction, and finite element analysis of a commercially available kick cycle. This project aims to understand the design, material selection, structural behavior, and safety margins of lightweight personal mobility systems.

## 📌 Project Overview

Reverse engineering of a kick cycle involves disassembling the product, measuring individual components, recreating accurate CAD models, and validating the design using finite element analysis (FEM).  
This project was carried out as part of the **Bachelor of Engineering (Mechanical Engineering)** curriculum at **KLE Technological University, Belagavi** during the academic year **2025–26**.
